<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Michelle Rodriguez. I'm from Mexico City, but grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Go Sooners! 
  I'm 36 years old. My son Eder, is 15 years old and a sophmore in high school. I love to dance, sing, horseback riding, 
  playing poker, and jumping out of airplanes.

<p>I decided to learn web development to be able to create my own spaces online. I think programming is such an invaluable skill to learn and as challenging
  as it can be, I think it can also be really fun. My personal goal is to finish this course before the year ends. Besides this course,
  I'm also taking the Data Analytics Google course and also learning French.
